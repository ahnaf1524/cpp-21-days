# C++ 21-Day Mission

Welcome to the C++ 21-Day Mission! This initiative is designed to help me build a strong foundation in C++ programming through structured and focused learning over 21 days.

## Recommended Resources

To enhance my understanding and become proficient in C++, make use of the following comprehensive documentation:

1. [C++ Reference (cppreference.com)](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)  
   - A detailed and authoritative resource for C++ language features, standard library components, and practical usage examples.

2. [cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com/)  
   - A beginner-friendly platform offering tutorials, examples, and documentation on C++ concepts and standard libraries.

## Goals for the Mission
- Develop a solid understanding of core C++ concepts and syntax.
- Familiarize yourself with advanced features, such as templates, STL, and modern C++ practices.
- Build problem-solving and debugging skills through hands-on exercises and projects.
- Create a foundation for tackling competitive programming, software development, or academic projects in C++.

## Guidelines
- Dedicate consistent time daily to practice and review.
- Supplement theoretical learning with hands-on coding exercises.
- Use the recommended resources to clarify doubts and expand your knowledge.
